# speech-to-text-AI
This repository provides a complete solution for transcribing, translating, and diarizing audio interview files locally using WhisperX Modal, configured to run entirely on your system. It is designed with privacy in mind, ensuring that all processing happens offlineâ€”no data is sent to any external server or cloud service. This makes it ideal for handling sensitive or confidential audio recordings, such as research interviews, internal company meetings, or private conversations.

The workflow begins by accepting an audio file (or batch of files) in either English or Spanish. The system first performs speaker diarization, automatically detecting and labeling the different speakers in the conversation as Speaker 1, Speaker 2, and so on. This is followed by the transcription phase, where the spoken content is converted into readable text. If the audio is in Spanish, it is translated into English, making it easier to work with bilingual data. All transcriptions are properly punctuated, resulting in clean, easy-to-read output. To support performance evaluation and benchmarking, the code also logs how much time it takes to process each audio file.
